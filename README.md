# BasicOCR
A basic optical recognition(OCR) program using Accord.NET and Tesseract

The program uses trained data from Tesseract for English, Hindi and Oriya.

The input image is a Bitmap(.bmp) and the program processes it and outputs: thresholded image, rotated-skewed image and a word document(.doc) containing the recognized text.

The results are currently inaccurate for Oriya.
